# React Survey

Many tutorials cover basics of React and Redux, but they aren't helpful in handling a real world project such as survey or questionnaire. React Survey project shows how to build a more complex web application with React and Redux. 

See live demo [here](https://aisensiy.github.io/react-survey)

## Run

The demo only shows a front end of the application. For a fully functioning application, the back end part is also necessary.

### Installing Front End

```sh
npm install
export REACT_APP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3000
npm start
```

### Installing Back End

Get the back end part from [here](https://github.com/aisensiy/rails-survey-backend). This is a Rails 5 application. You need to install Ruby on your machine. 

The fastest way to deploy the back end is to use [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
